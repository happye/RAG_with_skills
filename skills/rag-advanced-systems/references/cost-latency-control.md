# Cost and Latency Control

## Controls

- Dynamic top-k by estimated confidence.
- Context compression before generation.
- Tiered model selection by query risk.
- Result cache with TTL by document volatility.

## Guardrails

- Never trade away faithfulness for marginal speed gains.
- Keep user-visible latency budget explicit.

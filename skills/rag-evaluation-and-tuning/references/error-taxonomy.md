# Error Taxonomy

## Categories

- Indexing: missing or malformed source content.
- Retrieval: relevant chunks not retrieved.
- Reranking: relevant chunks retrieved but ranked too low.
- Prompting: context present but answer behavior poor.
- Model limits: reasoning gap despite sufficient context.

## Labeling Guideline

- Assign one primary label and optional secondary label.
- Attach one concrete evidence snippet for each label.

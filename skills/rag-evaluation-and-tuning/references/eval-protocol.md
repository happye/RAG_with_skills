# Evaluation Protocol

## Dataset Rules

- Use fixed datasets for comparability.
- Keep difficulty tags: simple lookup, multi-hop, ambiguous, noisy.

## Metrics

- Retrieval: Recall@k, nDCG@k.
- Generation: correctness, faithfulness, citation quality.
- System: latency p50/p95, cost per query.

## Reporting Cadence

- Report per run and per week.
- Include confidence notes for small-sample changes.
